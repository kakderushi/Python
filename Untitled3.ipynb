    "1) values and expreession are follows:\n",
    "values are:-87.8, 'hello' ,6\n",
    "Expression: *, /,+,-\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2)what are diffrence between string and variable\n",
    "\n",
    "String:\n",
    "    Strings are data type, so we can use them to store characters type of data.\n",
    "    for example: name=\"Rushikesh\"\n",
    "    \n",
    " Variable:\n",
    "         Variable are the symbols that you can use to store data in a program. \n",
    "         we can think of them as an empty box that you fill with some data of value.\n",
    "         In variable we could store any type of data like integer,float,string.\n",
    "         \n",
    " 3)Describe three different data types\n",
    "   \n",
    "           1)  int: This data types is used store integer values in the variable.\n",
    "                 example:a=10\n",
    "                 above example show a is varible which stored integer value in a.\n",
    "                 \n",
    "           2)float:This data type is used to stored decimal point of value in the a.\n",
    "                example: a=23.00\n",
    "                above example show a is variable which stored decimal value in the a.\n",
    "                \n",
    "                \n",
    "           3)str: This is store characters values in the variable.\n",
    "                    example:name=\"Rushi\"\n",
    "                    above example name variable store characters value.\n",
    "                    \n",
    "                    \n",
    "   4)What is an expresssion made of? what do \n",
    "        An expression is a conduct made up of variable ,operator and method invocations,\n",
    "        which are constructed according to the syntax of the language ,that evaluates to a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) this assingment statements,like spam=10, what is the diffrence between an expressions and a statement.\n",
    "        expressions:\n",
    "        Expressions in python produce some value or result after being interpreted by the python interpreter.\n",
    "        for example: 1,has a certain value while go()may be executed or not.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        statement:\n",
    "        Statement in python is used to creating variables or displaying values.\n",
    "        example: line or a block of code is a statement.\n",
    "            \n",
    "6)After running the following code,what does the variable bacon contain?\n",
    "\n",
    "        bacon=22\n",
    "        bacon+1\n",
    "        \n",
    "        ans: variable bacon contain 22\n",
    "7)what should the values of the following two terms be?\n",
    "        \n",
    "    'spam'+'spamspam'\n",
    "    'spam'*3\n",
    "    \n",
    "    frist term=spamspamspam\n",
    "    second term=spamspamspam\n",
    "    \n",
    "8)why is eggs valid variable name while 100 is invalid?\n",
    "    eggs is valid variable name because eggs follow varaible\n",
    "    declarations rule,which are it start wiht character rather than\n",
    "    any numeric value or special characters.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    100 is invalid variable name beacuse of it does'nt follow variable\n",
    "    declaration rule ,such as start with numeric value.\n",
    "    \n",
    "9)what three functions can be used to get the intger,floating-point number or string version of a value?\n",
    "\n",
    "        these three functions are followed:\n",
    "            int(),float()and str()\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "10)why does this expressions cause an error? how can you fix it?\n",
    "'i have eaten'+99+'burritos.'\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement cause errror  beacause we could concatenate only  string value \n",
    "In above example we used numeric value. that is reason it through an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "writing rather than above statement we can write it like that,\n",
    "\n",
    "'l have eaten'+'99'+'burritos.'\n"
